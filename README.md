# daily-event-sign
Displays today's events on an electronic sign.

This project has been coded with a 1360 x 768 display in mind. It should work on other display sizes with small changes to the CSS.

The master branch of this project can always be seen in action at https://forbeslibrary.github.io/daily-event-sign/
